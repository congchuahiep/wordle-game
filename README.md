# Wordle Game

This project is a tweakable Wordle, designed so anyone can easily open game rooms, adjust the rules, and turn word guessing into a fun game.

## Features
- Customize word length
- Set number of attempts
- Choose specific target words
- Create and join game rooms easily
- Confetti and sound effect when guessing 🎊

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wordle-game.git
cd wordle-game
npm install
npm start
```

## Motivation

I created this project for my girlfriend, who is training to become an English teacher and wants to make vocabulary lessons more engaging for her students. She enjoys playing Wordle, but the existing versions online are limited — they don’t allow customizing word length, number of attempts, or choosing specific target words.
